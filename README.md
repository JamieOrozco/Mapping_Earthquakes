# Mapping Earthquakes

Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
Technical analysis deliverables. 

•	Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

Added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and then added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

•	Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

Added color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and added a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer.

•	Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

Added a third map style to the earthquake map.
